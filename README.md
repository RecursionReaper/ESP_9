## 🧠 ML Model Architecture

Our AQI prediction model uses a Random Forest Regression approach trained on comprehensive datasets from multiple sources to predict air quality up to 3 days in advance.

### Model Features
- **Inputs**: PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity, wind speed, historical AQI trends
- **Output**: Predicted AQI values for the next 72 hours
- **Accuracy**: Achieves 87% prediction accuracy on test data
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R²

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Data collection from multiple sources
2. Feature engineering and selection
3. Outlier detection and handling
4. Missing value imputation
5. Normalization and scaling
6. Model training and hyperparameter tuning
7. Cross-validation and testing

### API Integration
The model is deployed as a Flask API that communicates with the mobile application through Firebase, enabling real-time predictions without excessive computational load on mobile devices.

## 🔌 Hardware Setup
